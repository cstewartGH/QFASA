* beta.meths.CI is deprecated and replaced by conf.meth. Hid this function and bias.all from index. Made several corrections to conf.meth code.
* prey.cluster was missing code.  Added example and default values.
* Added functions to compute repeatability.
* Added functions to compute diet estimates and calibration coefficients simultaneously.
* Added functions to compute diet estimates via MUFASA (i.e. ML estimation)


Added the following functions:

## QFASA 1.0.3
* Added functions to test a difference between two independent samples of compositional data.
* Added functions to calculate confidence intervals on diet estimates.
* Added functions to perform hierarchical clustering on prey database.
